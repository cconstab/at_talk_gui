# Biometric Storage Cleanup Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of robust biometric storage cleanup for the at_talk_gui Flutter application. This feature ensures that corrupted keychain/biometric storage data does not block onboarding or key management operations.

## Problem Addressed
When biometric/keychain storage becomes corrupted, users were unable to:
- Complete onboarding for new atSigns
- Manage existing atSign keys
- Recover from storage corruption issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Biometric Storage Dependency
- Added `biometric_storage: ^5.0.1` to `pubspec.yaml`
- This provides direct access to the biometric storage API for cleanup operations

### 2. Enhanced Onboarding Screen
- **File**: `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`
- **Function**: `_clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns(List<String> atSignList)`

#### Key Features:
- **Platform Compatibility**: Checks if biometric storage is available before attempting cleanup
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Attempts to delete biometric storage using multiple naming patterns that might be used by AtSign libraries:
  - `@atsign` (full atSign with @)
  - `atsign` (atSign without @)
  - `atsign_keys` (with keys suffix)
  - `atsign_atsign` (with atsign suffix)
  - `atsign_atsign` (prefixed with atsign)
  - `at_client_atsign` (AtClient specific)
  - `keychain_atsign` (Keychain specific)
- **Generic Cleanup**: Also attempts to clean up generic storage patterns:
  - `at_client`
  - `at_auth`
  - `atsign_keys`
  - `keychain_data`
  - `secure_storage`
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors and continues cleanup even if some entries fail
- **Logging**: Provides detailed console output for debugging

### 3. Integration Points
The biometric storage cleanup is integrated into the existing keychain cleanup flow:

```dart
// In _clearKeychainForAtSigns method
await KeychainUtil.clearEntries();
print('âœ… Keychain cleanup completed');

// NEW: Clear biometric storage after keychain cleanup
await _clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns(atSignList);
```

### 4. API Usage
The implementation uses the `biometric_storage` package correctly:

```dart
// Check platform support
final biometricStorage = BiometricStorage();
final canAuthenticate = await biometricStorage.canAuthenticate();

// Delete storage entries
final storageFile = await biometricStorage.getStorage(storageName);
await storageFile.delete();
```

## Testing
- Code compiles without errors
- Flutter analyze passes (only style warnings remain)
- App builds successfully on Windows
- Integration with existing cleanup flow maintains backward compatibility

## Benefits
1. **Robust Recovery**: Users can recover from corrupted biometric storage without manual intervention
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms that support biometric storage
3. **Comprehensive**: Covers various naming patterns used by different AtSign libraries
4. **Safe**: Non-destructive failure mode - if cleanup fails, it doesn't break existing functionality
5. **Debuggable**: Extensive logging helps troubleshoot cleanup issues

## Usage
The biometric storage cleanup runs automatically when:
1. Users trigger keychain cleanup from the onboarding screen
2. The system detects the need for cleanup during key management operations

No user interaction is required - the cleanup happens automatically as part of the existing cleanup workflow.

## Future Enhancements
- Could be extended to enumerate and clean all biometric storage entries if needed
- Could be integrated into other parts of the app where storage corruption might occur
- Could be made optional via user settings if desired

## Files Modified
- `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`: Added biometric storage cleanup logic
- `pubspec.yaml`: Added biometric_storage dependency

## Dependencies Added
- `biometric_storage: ^5.0.1`: For direct biometric storage management
