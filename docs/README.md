1. Place feature documentation in `development-history/`
2. Update this index file with appropriate links
3. Follow the established naming conventions (use descriptive, action-oriented names)
4. Include clear headings, cross-references, and status indicators
5. Document both the problem and the complete solution
6. Add implementation details for future maintainers

### Documentation Standards
- **Status Indicators**: Use ‚úÖ COMPLETE, üöß IN PROGRESS, ‚ùå DEPRECATED as appropriate
- **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation and code files  
- **Problem/Solution Format**: Clearly describe both what was broken and how it was fixed
- **Code Examples**: Include relevant code snippets with explanations
- **Testing Evidence**: Document how fixes were verified (e.g., `flutter analyze` results)

For technical questions, refer to the API documentation or the detailed implementation guides in the development history.
