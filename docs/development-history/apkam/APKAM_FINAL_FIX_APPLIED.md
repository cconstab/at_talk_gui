# APKAM Keychain Preservation - FINAL FIX APPLIED

## The REAL Root Cause (Finally Found!)

The issue was **NOT** in the onboarding dialogs as initially thought. The actual problem was in the **`AuthProvider.authenticate()` method** which both .atKeys and APKAM flows use for final authentication.

### The Problem Code
**File:** `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Line 47

```dart
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (Before fix):
await AtTalkService.configureAtSignStorage(atSign!, cleanupExisting: true);
```

This `cleanupExisting: true` parameter was **wiping the keychain** every time `authenticate()` was called!

### The Fix Applied
**File:** `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Line 47

```dart
// FIXED CODE (After fix):
await AtTalkService.configureAtSignStorage(atSign!, cleanupExisting: false);
```

Changed `cleanupExisting: true` to `cleanupExisting: false` to preserve existing atSigns in the keychain.

### Why This Was The Real Issue

1. **Both .atKeys and APKAM flows** call `AuthProvider.authenticate()` at the end
2. **Every time** `authenticate()` was called, it cleaned up the keychain
3. **This happened regardless** of whether OnboardingService was called or not
4. **The onboarding dialog fixes** were addressing symptoms, not the root cause

### Expected Behavior After Fix

**Test Scenario:**
1. Start with `@cconstab` in keychain
2. Add `@llama` via APKAM onboarding
3. **Expected result:** Keychain should contain `[@cconstab, @llama]`

**Debug Output to Watch For:**
```
üîß Configuring atSign-specific storage for: @llama
# Should see cleanupExisting: false instead of true
üîç Keychain BEFORE authentication: [@cconstab]
‚úÖ Authentication completed using AuthProvider - keychain preserved
üîç After authentication, keychain contains: [@cconstab, @llama]
```

### Files Modified

1. **`lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`** - Changed `cleanupExisting: true` to `cleanupExisting: false`
2. **`lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`** - Previous onboarding dialog fixes (still beneficial)

### Testing Instructions

1. Start fresh with one atSign in keychain
2. Add another atSign via APKAM onboarding
3. Verify both atSigns are present in keychain
4. Restart app and verify both atSigns persist

This should be the **final fix** that actually resolves the keychain preservation issue.
