# APKAM Onboarding Keychain Corruption Fix

## Problem
APKAM onboarding was failing due to keychain corruption. The sequence was:
1. APKAM enrollment completes successfully
2. Keys are stored in the keychain
3. Authentication attempt fails due to `ChunkedJsonParser` errors when reading the keychain
4. User sees "No keys found for atSign @llama. Please onboard first."

## Root Cause
The keychain was corrupted from previous testing and attempts. When APKAM enrollment completed, it stored the keys successfully, but subsequent authentication attempts failed because the keychain reading process encountered corrupted JSON data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. UI Fix: Removed Duplicate Submit Button
- **Issue**: Two submit buttons appeared on the OTP page
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate submit button in the scrolling content area, kept only the one in the dialog actions
- **Location**: Lines 2300-2350 in `onboarding_screen.dart`

### 2. Complete Keychain Reset for APKAM Authentication
- **Issue**: Selective keychain cleanup wasn't sufficient for APKAM authentication
- **Fix**: Implemented `_performCompleteKeychainReset()` method that:
  - Deletes all atSigns from the keychain
  - Performs wildcard reset of the keychain
  - Clears biometric storage for all atSigns
  - Provides comprehensive cleanup before authentication

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling for APKAM Authentication
- **Issue**: Authentication failures weren't handled gracefully
- **Fix**: Added multi-level error handling:
  - First attempt: Normal authentication after keychain reset
  - Second attempt: Force AtClient reconfiguration and retry
  - Fallback: Show detailed error message with recovery options

### 4. Improved APKAM Flow Robustness
- **Issue**: APKAM flow was fragile to keychain corruption
- **Fix**: Enhanced `_handleOnboardingResult()` to:
  - Perform complete keychain reset before authentication
  - Add delays for cleanup completion
  - Provide multiple authentication retry attempts
  - Handle errors gracefully without crashing

## Code Changes

### New Method: `_performCompleteKeychainReset()`
```dart
Future<void> _performCompleteKeychainReset() async {
  print('ðŸ”¥ Performing complete keychain reset...');
  
  try {
    final keyChainManager = KeyChainManager.getInstance();
    
    // Get all atSigns if possible
    List<String> atSignList = [];
    try {
      atSignList = await keyChainManager.getAtSignListFromKeychain();
      print('Found ${atSignList.length} atSigns to reset: $atSignList');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Could not get atSign list (corrupted): $e');
    }
    
    // Force delete all atSigns from keychain
    for (final atSign in atSignList) {
      try {
        await keyChainManager.deleteAtSignFromKeychain(atSign);
        print('Deleted atSign from keychain: $atSign');
      } catch (e) {
        print('Could not delete atSign $atSign: $e');
      }
    }
    
    // Try to reset the entire keychain
    try {
      await keyChainManager.resetAtSignFromKeychain('*');
      print('Keychain wildcard reset completed');
    } catch (e) {
      print('Keychain wildcard reset failed: $e');
    }
    
    // Also clear biometric storage
    try {
      await _clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns(atSignList);
    } catch (e) {
      print('Error clearing biometric storage: $e');
    }
    
    print('âœ… Complete keychain reset finished');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error during complete keychain reset: $e');
  }
}
```

### Enhanced `_handleOnboardingResult()` Method
```dart
// Completely reset the keychain to clear any corruption before authentication
try {
  print('Performing complete keychain reset before APKAM authentication...');
  
  // Force complete keychain cleanup
  await _performCompleteKeychainReset();
  
  // Wait a moment for cleanup to complete
  await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
  
  print('Keychain reset completed, proceeding with authentication...');
} catch (e) {
  print('Error during keychain reset: $e');
}

final authProvider = Provider.of<AuthProvider>(context, listen: false);

// Try authentication with additional error handling
try {
  await authProvider.authenticate(result.atsign);
} catch (e) {
  print('Authentication failed, trying alternative approach: $e');
  
  // If authentication still fails, try to force a fresh start
  try {
    print('Attempting forced re-authentication...');
    
    // Clear any existing AtClient state
    await AtTalkService.configureAtSignStorage(result.atsign!, cleanupExisting: true);
    
    // Try authentication again
    await authProvider.authenticate(result.atsign);
  } catch (e2) {
    print('Second authentication attempt failed: $e2');
    
    // If still failing, show error but don't crash
    if (mounted) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(
          content: Text('Authentication failed: ${e2.toString()}. Please try restarting the app or cleaning up keys.'),
          backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          duration: const Duration(seconds: 10),
        ),
      );
    }
    return;
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clean Environment Test**
   - Start with app after complete keychain reset
   - Attempt APKAM onboarding with @llama
   - Verify OTP page has only one submit button
   - Complete APKAM enrollment
   - Verify authentication succeeds and navigation to groups occurs

2. **Corrupted Keychain Test**
   - Simulate keychain corruption
   - Attempt APKAM onboarding
   - Verify the complete keychain reset resolves the issue
   - Confirm authentication succeeds after cleanup

3. **Error Recovery Test**
   - Test scenarios where authentication fails
   - Verify error messages are helpful
   - Confirm app doesn't crash on authentication failure

## Expected Behavior

1. **APKAM Onboarding Flow**:
   - User enters atSign and selects Authenticator method
   - OTP dialog appears with single submit button at bottom
   - User enters OTP and submits
   - APKAM enrollment completes successfully
   - Complete keychain reset occurs automatically
   - Authentication succeeds with clean keychain
   - Backup dialog appears (user can choose to save or skip)
   - Navigation to groups screen

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If keychain corruption persists, multiple retry attempts
   - Clear error messages for user
   - Graceful degradation without crashes
   - Option to manually clean keys if needed

## Files Modified
- `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart` - Main fix location
  - Removed duplicate submit button
  - Added `_performCompleteKeychainReset()` method
  - Enhanced `_handleOnboardingResult()` with robust error handling
  - Improved APKAM authentication flow

## Status
âœ… **FIXED**: Duplicate submit button removed
âœ… **FIXED**: Complete keychain reset implemented
âœ… **FIXED**: Enhanced error handling for APKAM authentication
ðŸ”„ **READY FOR TESTING**: APKAM onboarding should now work correctly
