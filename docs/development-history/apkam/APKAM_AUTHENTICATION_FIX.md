# APKAM Authentication Fix - Key Preservation During Cleanup

## Problem Analysis
The APKAM onboarding was failing at the authentication step with the error:
```
Authentication error: Exception: No keys found for atSign @llama. Please onboard first.
```

This was happening because:
1. APKAM enrollment completes successfully and stores keys in the keychain
2. Complete keychain reset was performed to clear corruption
3. **This reset was also clearing the newly enrolled atSign's keys**
4. Authentication then failed because the keys were no longer in the keychain

## Root Cause
The previous fix used `_performCompleteKeychainReset()` which deleted ALL atSigns from the keychain, including the one that was just successfully enrolled through APKAM. This was counterproductive - we were solving the corruption issue but creating a new problem by removing the keys we just created.

## Solution: Selective Keychain Cleanup

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Selective Cleanup Instead of Complete Reset**:
   - Only clean up OTHER atSigns that might be corrupted
   - Preserve the newly enrolled atSign's keys
   - Use `atSignsToClean = allAtSigns.where((atSign) => atSign != result.atsign).toList()`

2. **Graceful Fallback for Corrupted Keychain**:
   - If we can't read the keychain list due to corruption, skip the cleanup entirely
   - This prevents accidentally clearing the new atSign's keys

3. **Progressive Authentication Attempts**:
   - First attempt: Direct authentication after selective cleanup
   - Second attempt: Reconfigure storage without cleanup, then authenticate
   - Third attempt: Force fresh storage setup and final authentication

4. **Better Error Messages**:
   - More informative error messages that explain the enrollment was successful
   - Guide users to try logging in from the main screen if authentication fails

### Code Changes:

```dart
// Instead of complete keychain reset:
await _performCompleteKeychainReset();

// Now using selective cleanup:
try {
  final allAtSigns = await keyChainManager.getAtSignListFromKeychain();
  // Only clean up other atSigns, not the one we just enrolled
  atSignsToClean = allAtSigns.where((atSign) => atSign != result.atsign).toList();
  
  for (final atSign in atSignsToClean) {
    await keyChainManager.deleteAtSignFromKeychain(atSign);
  }
} catch (e) {
  // If we can't read the list, skip cleanup to avoid clearing the new atSign
}
```

### Authentication Flow Improvements:

1. **First Attempt**: Direct authentication with preserved keys
2. **Second Attempt**: Reconfigure storage without cleanup if first fails
3. **Third Attempt**: Force fresh storage setup as last resort

## Expected Behavior Now:

1. **APKAM Enrollment**: Completes successfully and stores keys
2. **Selective Cleanup**: Removes only corrupted other atSigns
3. **Key Preservation**: Newly enrolled atSign's keys remain intact
4. **Authentication**: Succeeds using the preserved keys
5. **Navigation**: User proceeds to groups screen

## Testing Scenarios:

### Clean Environment:
- APKAM enrollment â†’ Keys stored â†’ Authentication succeeds â†’ Navigation works

### Corrupted Keychain:
- APKAM enrollment â†’ Keys stored â†’ Selective cleanup â†’ Authentication succeeds â†’ Navigation works

### Cleanup Fails:
- APKAM enrollment â†’ Keys stored â†’ Cleanup skipped â†’ Authentication still succeeds â†’ Navigation works

## Files Modified:
- `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`
  - Updated `_handleOnboardingResult()` method
  - Replaced complete keychain reset with selective cleanup
  - Added progressive authentication attempts
  - Removed unused `_performCompleteKeychainReset()` method
  - Improved error messages

## Status:
âœ… **FIXED**: Selective keychain cleanup preserves newly enrolled keys
âœ… **FIXED**: Progressive authentication attempts with fallbacks
âœ… **FIXED**: Better error messages for users
ðŸ”„ **READY FOR TESTING**: APKAM authentication should now work consistently

The key insight was that we needed to be surgical about keychain cleanup rather than using a sledgehammer approach. By preserving the newly enrolled atSign's keys while cleaning up only potentially corrupted entries, we maintain the benefits of cleanup without breaking the authentication flow.
