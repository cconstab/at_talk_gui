# Onboarding Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Biometric Storage Cleanup
- **Problem**: Corrupted biometric storage was blocking onboarding flows
- **Solution**: Implemented `_clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns()` function that clears biometric storage for all atSigns and generic patterns
- **Integration**: Added biometric cleanup to the keychain cleanup flow in `_clearKeychainForAtSigns()`
- **Dependencies**: Added `biometric_storage: ^5.0.1` to pubspec.yaml

### 2. Login Flow State Management
- **Problem**: After logout and login with different atSign, old group and side panel state persisted
- **Solution**: Updated `_loginWithExistingAtSign()` to clear group and side panel state before authentication and reinitialize after
- **Implementation**: Added calls to `groupsProvider.clearAllGroups()` and `sidePanelProvider.clearState()`

### 3. APKAM Onboarding Flow
- **Problem**: Backup dialog appeared multiple times, unnecessary delays, and incorrect navigation
- **Solution**: 
  - Backup dialog now appears only once
  - Removed unnecessary delays
  - Navigation goes directly into the app after backup
  - Improved APKAM dialog UI: removed duplicate buttons, increased height, made submit button more prominent

### 4. CRAM and PKAM Onboarding Flows
- **Problem**: Inconsistent navigation and backup dialog logic
- **Solution**: Updated to match improved APKAM flow with consistent navigation and backup dialog handling

### 5. Onboarding Dialog Management
- **Problem**: Dialogs were being refreshed or shown after successful navigation
- **Solution**: Updated `_showOnboardingDialog()` to avoid refreshing the onboarding screen or showing dialogs after successful navigation

### 6. AtSign List Display Issue
- **Problem**: After APKAM onboarding and logout, only the new atSign appeared in the list
- **Solution**: Updated `groups_list_screen.dart` to use `getAtsignEntries()` (from `atsign_manager.dart`) for the atSign switcher, ensuring all atSigns are shown

### 7. .atKeys Flow Improvement
- **Problem**: Backup dialog was shown even when user already had the keys file
- **Solution**: Removed backup dialog from .atKeys onboarding flow since the user already has the keys

## Key Implementation Details

### Biometric Storage Cleanup
```dart
Future<void> _clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns(List<String> atSigns) async {
  try {
    final biometricStorage = await BiometricStorage.getNativeStorage();
    
    // Clear storage for each atSign
    for (final atSign in atSigns) {
      final cleanAtSign = atSign.replaceAll('@', '');
      await biometricStorage.delete(key: cleanAtSign);
      await biometricStorage.delete(key: '@$cleanAtSign');
    }
    
    // Clear generic patterns
    await biometricStorage.delete(key: 'biometric_auth_enabled');
    await biometricStorage.delete(key: 'user_preferences');
    
    log('Biometric storage cleared for atSigns: $atSigns');
  } catch (e) {
    log('Error clearing biometric storage: $e');
  }
}
```

### AtSign Switcher Fix
```dart
// In groups_list_screen.dart
final atSignEntries = await getAtsignEntries();
```

### Navigation Improvements
- Direct navigation to main app after successful onboarding
- Single backup dialog appearance
- Consistent state management across all flows

## Critical Fix: Keychain Corruption Prevention

### Problem
- Calling `AtOnboarding.onboard()` after APKAM approval was causing keychain corruption
- This resulted in `ChunkedJsonParser` errors and made subsequent onboarding attempts fail

### Solution
- **REVERTED** the change that called `AtOnboarding.onboard()` after APKAM approval
- APKAM enrollment process itself handles key storage properly
- No additional onboarding call needed after approval

### Code Removed
```dart
// This code was REMOVED to prevent keychain corruption:
// After APKAM approval, we need to complete the onboarding process
// to ensure keys are properly stored in the keychain
try {
  log('Completing onboarding process after APKAM approval...');
  
  // Use AtOnboarding.onboard to complete the process and ensure keychain is updated
  final result = await AtOnboarding.onboard(
    context: context,
    atsign: atsign,
    config: AtOnboardingConfig(
      atClientPreference: atClientPreference,
      rootEnvironment: AtTalkEnv.rootEnvironment,
    ),
  );
  
  log('Post-APKAM onboarding result: ${result.status}');
  
  if (result.status != AtOnboardingResultStatus.success) {
    log('Post-APKAM onboarding failed: ${result.message}');
    // If the secondary onboarding fails, we still consider the APKAM enrollment successful
    // since the enrollment itself was approved
  }
} catch (e) {
  log('Error in post-APKAM onboarding: $e');
  // Continue anyway since the APKAM enrollment was successful
}
```

## Testing Required

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **APKAM Onboarding Flow**
   - Create new atSign with APKAM
   - Verify backup dialog appears only once
   - Verify navigation goes directly to app after backup
   - Logout and verify all atSigns appear in the list

2. **CRAM Onboarding Flow**
   - Test with QR code
   - Verify backup dialog and navigation consistency

3. **PKAM Onboarding Flow**
   - Test with .atKeys file
   - Verify no backup dialog appears
   - Verify smooth navigation

4. **Mixed AtSign Management**
   - Add multiple atSigns with different methods
   - Verify all appear in switcher after logout
   - Test switching between atSigns

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Test keychain cleanup and biometric cleanup
   - Verify onboarding works after cleanup

## Files Modified
- `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart` - Main onboarding logic and UI
- `lib/core/services/at_talk_service.dart` - atSign storage configuration
- `lib/core/services/key_backup_service.dart` - Key backup logic
- `lib/core/utils/atsign_manager.dart` - AtSign management
- `lib/gui/widgets/key_management_dialog.dart` - Key management dialog
- `lib/core/providers/groups_provider.dart` - Group state management
- `lib/gui/screens/groups_list_screen.dart` - AtSign switcher
- `lib/gui/widgets/side_panel.dart` - Side panel state
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies

## Dependencies Added
- `biometric_storage: ^5.0.1` - For biometric storage cleanup

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**: All major onboarding flow issues have been addressed
âœ… **REVERTED**: Keychain corruption fix - removed problematic `AtOnboarding.onboard()` call
ðŸ”„ **READY FOR TESTING**: Manual testing needed to verify all flows work correctly

## Next Steps
1. Manual testing of all onboarding flows (APKAM, CRAM, PKAM)
2. Verify atSign list shows all atSigns after onboarding
3. Test backup dialog behavior in each flow
4. Test error recovery and cleanup flows
5. Optional: Further UI/UX improvements based on testing feedback
