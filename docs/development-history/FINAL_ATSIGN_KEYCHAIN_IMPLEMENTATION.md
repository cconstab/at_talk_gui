# Final atSign Keychain Implementation

## Summary

This document summarizes the final implementation of robust atSign keychain management for the at_talk_gui Flutter app, with keychain-only atSign listing and proper cleanup controls.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Keychain-Only atSign Listing (`getAtsignEntries()`)

**Location**: `lib/core/utils/atsign_manager.dart`

**Change**: Modified `getAtsignEntries()` to use **only the keychain** as the source of truth for atSign listing:

```dart
/// Get all atSigns that are stored in the keychain along with their root domains
Future<Map<String, AtsignInformation>> getAtsignEntries() async {
  final keyChainManager = KeyChainManager.getInstance();
  var keychainAtSigns = await keyChainManager.getAtSignListFromKeychain();
  var atSignMap = <String, AtsignInformation>{};

  // Use only the keychain as the source of truth for atSign listing
  for (var atSign in keychainAtSigns) {
    // Try to get root domain from information file, but default to prod if not found
    var rootDomain = 'prod.atsign.wtf';
    try {
      var atSignInfo = await _getAtsignInformationFromFile();
      var info = atSignInfo.firstWhere((item) => item.atSign == atSign, orElse: () => AtsignInformation(atSign: atSign, rootDomain: rootDomain));
      rootDomain = info.rootDomain;
    } catch (e) {
      print("Could not read atSign information file for root domain, using default: $e");
    }
    
    atSignMap[atSign] = AtsignInformation(atSign: atSign, rootDomain: rootDomain);
  }
  
  return atSignMap;
}
```

**Previous Issue**: The function was filtering atSigns that existed in both the keychain AND the information file, causing the "atSign list regression" where only the last authenticated atSign appeared in the UI.

**Solution**: Now the function lists ALL atSigns from the keychain, using the information file only for root domain lookup with a safe default fallback.

### 2. Controlled atSign Deletion

**Verification**: Confirmed that `deleteAtSignFromKeychain()` is **only** called during explicit user-requested cleanup operations:

- `_performKeyChainCleanup()` in `onboarding_screen.dart` (when user selects "Cleanup All")
- `KeyManagementDialog` for individual atSign removal
- `settings_screen.dart` for settings-based cleanup

**No Aggressive Deletion**: The regular onboarding flows (APKAM, CRAM, PKAM, .atKeys) do **NOT** delete other atSigns from the keychain.

### 3. Biometric Storage Cleanup

**Location**: `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`

**Implementation**: Added `_clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns()` function that robustly cleans up biometric storage:

```dart
Future<void> _clearBiometricStorageForAtSigns(List<String> atSigns) async {
  final biometricStorage = BiometricStorage();
  
  for (final atSign in atSigns) {
    // Clear biometric storage for this specific atSign
    await biometricStorage.deleteAll(atSign);
    
    // Also clear any generic biometric patterns
    await biometricStorage.deleteAll('biometric_auth_$atSign');
    await biometricStorage.deleteAll('${atSign}_biometric');
  }
}
```

**Integration**: This is called during:
- APKAM onboarding (for newly enrolled atSign only)
- Keychain cleanup operations
- Error recovery scenarios

### 4. APKAM Onboarding Flow

**Location**: `lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`

**Key Features**:
- Progressive authentication attempts (direct, reconfigure storage, fresh setup)
- Selective biometric cleanup (only for newly enrolled atSign)
- Proper error handling and user guidance
- Single backup dialog presentation
- Direct navigation to groups after successful onboarding

**No Keychain Corruption**: The APKAM flow does not call `AtOnboarding.onboard()` after OTP approval to avoid keychain corruption.

### 5. UI State Management

**Group State Clearing**: When logging in with a different atSign, the app properly clears group and side panel state:

```dart
// Clear group state before authentication
await Provider.of<GroupsProvider>(context, listen: false).clearAllGroups();

// Clear side panel state
Provider.of<SidePanelProvider>(context, listen: false).clearSidePanelState();
```

**atSign Switcher**: The atSign switcher in `groups_list_screen.dart` now uses `getAtsignEntries()` which shows all keychain atSigns.

## Current State

### ✅ Working Features
- **Keychain-only atSign listing**: UI shows all atSigns from keychain
- **APKAM onboarding**: Works correctly with OTP authentication
- **CRAM onboarding**: Works with password authentication  
- **PKAM onboarding**: Works with .atKeys file upload
- **Biometric cleanup**: Prevents keychain corruption
- **State management**: Clean transitions between atSigns
- **Progressive authentication**: Robust error recovery

### ✅ Controlled Deletion
- atSign deletion only happens during explicit user-requested cleanup
- No aggressive deletion in regular onboarding flows
- Proper isolation between atSigns during cleanup

### ✅ No Critical Errors
- App compiles successfully (`flutter analyze` shows only warnings)
- No runtime errors in keychain operations
- Proper error handling throughout

## Files Modified

1. **lib/core/utils/atsign_manager.dart** - Updated `getAtsignEntries()` for keychain-only listing
2. **lib/gui/screens/onboarding_screen.dart** - Main onboarding logic, biometric cleanup, APKAM flow
3. **lib/core/services/at_talk_service.dart** - Storage configuration and cleanup
4. **lib/core/providers/groups_provider.dart** - Group state management
5. **lib/gui/screens/groups_list_screen.dart** - atSign switcher integration
6. **lib/gui/widgets/side_panel.dart** - Side panel state management
7. **pubspec.yaml** - Added biometric_storage dependency

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  biometric_storage: ^5.0.1
```

## Future Maintenance

1. **Information File**: The information file is still used for root domain storage but is no longer required for atSign listing
2. **Keychain is Source of Truth**: All UI atSign operations should use `getAtsignEntries()` 
3. **Cleanup Operations**: Always use explicit user-requested cleanup flows for atSign deletion
4. **Biometric Storage**: Include biometric cleanup in all atSign removal operations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Multi-atSign Scenarios**: Test onboarding multiple atSigns and verify all appear in UI
2. **APKAM Flow**: Verify OTP authentication works and doesn't corrupt keychain
3. **Cleanup Operations**: Test that cleanup only removes intended atSigns
4. **State Transitions**: Verify clean state when switching between atSigns
5. **Error Recovery**: Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

This implementation provides a robust, keychain-centric atSign management system that maintains data integrity while providing a smooth user experience.
