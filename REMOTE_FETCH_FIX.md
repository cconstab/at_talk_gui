# File Transfer Remote Fetching Fix

## Problem
When downloading files from a different atSign, the receiver was not properly fetching AtKeys from the remote atServer where the sender had uploaded them. This could cause issues with file sharing between different atSigns.

## Solution
Modified the file download process to explicitly fetch from the remote atServer when downloading files from a different atSign.

## Changes Made

### 1. Metadata Fetching Enhancement
**File**: `lib/core/services/file_transfer_service.dart`
**Method**: `_downloadFileFromAtPlatform()`

**Before:**
```dart
final result = await client.get(metadataKey).timeout(chunkTimeout);
```

**After:**
```dart
final isRemoteFetch = fromAtSign != null && fromAtSign != AtTalkService.instance.currentAtSign;
final result = isRemoteFetch
    ? await client.get(metadataKey, getRequestOptions: GetRequestOptions()..bypassCache = true).timeout(chunkTimeout)
    : await client.get(metadataKey).timeout(chunkTimeout);
```

### 2. Chunk Fetching Enhancement
**File**: `lib/core/services/file_transfer_service.dart`
**Method**: `_downloadChunkWithRetry()`

**Before:**
```dart
final chunkResult = await client.get(chunkKey).timeout(chunkTimeout);
```

**After:**
```dart
final isRemoteFetch = fromAtSign != null && fromAtSign != AtTalkService.instance.currentAtSign;
final chunkResult = isRemoteFetch
    ? await client.get(chunkKey, getRequestOptions: GetRequestOptions()..bypassCache = true).timeout(chunkTimeout)
    : await client.get(chunkKey).timeout(chunkTimeout);
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added debug logging to clearly indicate when remote vs local fetching is being used:
- `ðŸ“¥ Remote fetch from: @sender` - when fetching from a different atSign
- `ðŸ“¥ Local fetch from: @current` - when fetching from the current atSign

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The system detects if `fromAtSign` is different from the current user's atSign
2. **Remote Fetching**: When downloading from a different atSign, uses `GetRequestOptions()..bypassCache = true` to ensure fresh data from the remote atServer
3. **Local Fetching**: When downloading your own files, uses normal local caching for better performance
4. **Fallback**: If `fromAtSign` is null, defaults to current user's atSign (backward compatibility)

## Benefits

- **Cross-atSign File Sharing**: Files can now be properly downloaded from other atSigns
- **Cache Bypassing**: Ensures fresh data is fetched from the remote atServer
- **Performance Optimization**: Local files still use caching for better performance
- **Debugging**: Clear logging shows whether remote or local fetching is being used
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without modifications

## Technical Details

- **GetRequestOptions**: Used to control how the AtClient fetches data
- **bypassCache**: Ensures the request goes to the remote atServer rather than using local cache
- **Remote vs Local**: The system automatically determines the appropriate fetching method based on the sender's atSign

This fix ensures that when a user receives a file from another atSign, the download process correctly fetches the file chunks from the sender's remote atServer rather than looking in the local cache where they wouldn't exist.
