# Direct Remote Put Optimization - AtClient PutRequestOptions

## Overview

Upgraded the file transfer service to use `PutRequestOptions.useRemoteAtServer = true` instead of the `syncService.sync()` approach for immediate remote availability of uploaded files.

## Key Changes

### Previous Approach (Using Sync Service):
```dart
// Upload to local then sync to remote
await client.put(metadataKey, jsonEncode(metadata));
client.syncService.sync(); // Triggers background sync

await client.put(chunkKey, chunkData);
// After all chunks: client.syncService.sync();
```

### New Approach (Direct Remote Put):
```dart
// Upload directly to remote atServer
await client.put(metadataKey, jsonEncode(metadata), 
    putRequestOptions: PutRequestOptions()..useRemoteAtServer = true);

await client.put(chunkKey, chunkData, 
    putRequestOptions: PutRequestOptions()..useRemoteAtServer = true);
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Availability**: Files are available immediately on the remote atServer without waiting for sync
2. **No Sync Dependency**: Eliminates reliance on background sync processes
3. **Better Performance**: Direct remote put is more efficient than local put + sync
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removes the need for multiple sync service calls
5. **Guaranteed Persistence**: Data goes directly to the authoritative remote server

## Implementation Details

### File Metadata Upload
- `PutRequestOptions()..useRemoteAtServer = true` forces metadata to go directly to remote
- Immediate availability for cross-atSign file sharing

### File Chunk Upload
- Each chunk is uploaded directly to remote atServer
- No local storage followed by sync process
- Ensures all chunks are immediately available to other atSigns

### Error Handling
- Maintains existing retry mechanisms
- Direct remote put failures are handled the same way as local put failures
- Timeout handling remains consistent

## AtClient PutRequestOptions Documentation

From the AtClient SDK:
```dart
/// Parameters that application code can optionally provide when calling
/// `AtClient.put`
class PutRequestOptions extends RequestOptions {
  /// Whether to send this update request directly to the remote atServer
  bool useRemoteAtServer = false;
}
```

## Impact on File Transfer Flow

1. **Upload Process**:
   - File metadata → Direct remote put
   - File chunks → Direct remote put (sequential)
   - No sync operations needed

2. **Cross-atSign Sharing**:
   - Files are immediately available to receiver
   - No waiting for sync cycles
   - Consistent behavior across all atSigns

3. **Performance**:
   - Eliminates local storage overhead for upload
   - Reduces network round trips (no sync required)
   - Faster file availability

## Files Modified

- `lib/core/services/file_transfer_service.dart`
  - Updated `_uploadFileToAtPlatform()` method
  - Updated `_uploadChunkWithRetry()` method
  - Removed sync service calls
  - Added direct remote put using PutRequestOptions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cross-atSign File Sharing**: Verify files are immediately available without sync delays
2. **Network Resilience**: Test direct remote put with network interruptions
3. **Performance**: Compare upload times with previous sync-based approach
4. **Error Recovery**: Ensure retry mechanisms work with direct remote put

## Technical Notes

- `PutRequestOptions.useRemoteAtServer` was added in AtClient SDK v3.0.60
- This approach bypasses local storage and goes directly to remote atServer
- Compatible with existing AtClient retry and timeout mechanisms
- No changes needed to download/fetch logic (still uses remote fetching)
